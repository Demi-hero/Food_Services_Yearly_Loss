# Food_Services_Yearly_Loss
I want to examine the life time of food services in the UK to see how long they last. 

I will be using the Companies House API to assist in the musing

In this I will be looking at all food serviing companies which on the Companies House API are stored with the following codes

56101	Licenced restaurants
56102	Unlicenced restaurants and cafes
56103	Take-away food shops and mobile food stands
56210	Event catering activities
56290	Other food services

Current Progress of the Project:
Learn how to use the companies house API.
